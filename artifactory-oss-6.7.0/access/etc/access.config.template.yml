# DO NOT IMPORT THIS FILE.
# This file describes the JFrog Access YAML configuration file and should only be
# as a reference.
#
# To change the configuration in an Access service, follow these instructions:
# 1. Find the value you want to update
# 2. Set the value in the access.config.latest.yml file under [access-home]/etc
# 3. Change access.config.latest.yml to access.config.import.yml
# 4. Restart Access
